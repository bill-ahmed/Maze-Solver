# Maze-Solver
An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to solve a given maze.

## Pre-conditions:
1. The maze must use the PPM file format (and contain only black/white colour values)
2. The start of the maze must be at pixel (0,0) and end at (X, Y), where X & Y are the dimensions of the image

This program requires Python 3.
