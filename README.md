# Maze Solver
An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to solve a given maze.

## Pre-conditions
1. The maze must use the PPM file format (and contain only black/white colour values)
2. The start of the maze must be at pixel (0,0) and end at (X, Y), where X & Y are the dimensions of the image


## Running the Program
This script requires Python 3. To Run: `python MazeSolver.py`

Results will be saved in the "output" folder, and there are two sample images in the "images" folder.

## Info
This was created as part of the second-year "Design and Analysis of Data Structures" course at the University of Toronto.
